1.
No description and verbose of what the orchestrator.py is doing
- silent execution
- no status information
- verbose mode - provide step - by - step  logs of its internal actions

2.
Make Writable sessions

3. 
Provide description on how to run the app

4. 
Use only the latest version of Next.js

5.
Solve release_engineer problem

6. 
From full prompt, prepare sub prompts for individual agents such as designer, frontend or backend

7.
Compare orchestrator.py to multi_agent_workflow_deterministic_ver3_finance.py and explain why there are more prompts in multi_agent_workflow_deterministic_ver3_finance.py agent specific then in orchestrator. Also explain which setup is better and more modular. And where in orchestrator.py the subagents recieive their sub prompts.

8.
- Use .orchestrator logs to analyse the failures
- See which part of the code in orchestrator.py code is responsible for those failures
- See which part of Prompt_4 is responsible for building in those failures into orchestrator.py

9.
Orchestrator.py does not use a single fixed prompt per role. It builds a set of candidate prompts (“variants”) for each agent step, then chooses one variant each run using a policy. I want to have a step logged and writen to a file for each agent step.

10.
Add a schema-constrained planning step before specialists
- Why: forces coherent role/output contracts up front.

Pass a hashed manifest snapshot into every specialist prompt
- Why: improves reproducibility and reduces silent drift in what agents assume exists.

Run independent steps in parallel with one combined policy check
- Why: faster generation and cleaner separation of independent concerns.

Add explicit docs/runbook deliverables as first-class artifacts
- Why: complete app output, not just code skeleton.

Add pluggable “data-specialist” role pattern
- Why: enables stronger app creation for data-heavy projects (scan/index/normalize before UI/API).

11. 
The frontend of the application flow must utilize the created backend.
